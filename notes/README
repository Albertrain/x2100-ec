Notes to self, and copies of my Ghidra database, for anyone else who might
find it useful.  If you have questions about what I mean by any of the stuff
in ec-notes, I can probably explain if you drop me a line.  Mostly they are
for my own benefit, in no particular order, and are unlikely to make sense
to anyone else.
